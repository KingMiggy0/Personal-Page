            <p>Hello World! My name is Miguel Pena, and I am originally from the Dominican Republic. I have been living in New York since I was eight years old. 
                My passion for Information Technology began at a young age, inspired by my brother who was always tinkering with computers and coding.
                Currently, I work in administration at a charter school, where I also handle numerous IT-related issues and provide solutions. 
                This experience has solidified my desire to advance my career in the IT field. I am eager to bring my problem-solving skills and technical 
                expertise to a dynamic IT company where I can continue to grow and make meaningful contributions.</p>
